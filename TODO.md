Will be fixed later:

- SERVER_URL is set to localhost (remote db preload works only on a local machine)
- UI is not complete/polished
- StartActivity: not all buttons are functional
- Performance is not fully optimized (loop string concats, omitted @Singleton, etc)
- Translation is 90% complete
- Firebase services temporarily removed
